          <p class>
            A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that is traditionally
            prepared with steamed milk foam. Variations of the drink involve the
            use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes and
            flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder.

          <h3 class="title title2">Espresso</h3>
          <p>
            Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of French origin, in which a
            small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under 9–10 bars of
            pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso can be made
            with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees.
